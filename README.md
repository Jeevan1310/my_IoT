## Breath Analyser using MQ3
_INFO_
A breathalyzer is a generalized trademarked name for  devices used for determining blood alcohol content from a breath sample. This means the device can detect from your breadth, the amount of alcohol you have taken. This device becomes very useful when you consider several cases of accidents caused by drunk driving. With this device, you can easily warn the driver of a car when he/she is too drunk to drive a car. It is important to note that this project is not accurate enough to replace the standard breathalyzer and you shouldnâ€™t drink and drive.
